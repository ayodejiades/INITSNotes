# Databases

I read the Wikipedia's entry on [databases](https://wikipedia.com/) and took notes of the following:

- In computing, a database is an organized collection of data or a type of data store based on the use of database management system (DBMS)
- The concept of database was made possible by the emergence of direct access storage media such as magnetic disks.

- The development of database technology can be divided into three eras based on data model or structure
  - Navigational
  - SQL/Relational
  - Post-relational

- Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage
- The Oxford English Dictionary cites a 1962 report by the System Development Corporation of California as the first to use the term "database" in a specific technical sense.
-[Charles Bachman](https://wikipedia.com/) founded the Database Task Group within CODASYL, the group responsible for the creation and standardization of COBOL.
- In 1971, the Database Task Group delivered their standard, which generally became known as the CODASYL approach.
